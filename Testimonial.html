"Purchasing my first puppy from Doodle Rach puppies was the best decision I’ve ever made!<br> My mini tri colored bernedoodle Louie, is one of the most well behaved, beautiful and, kind puppies I’ve come across.<br> The process of getting my puppy as well was very easy, David and his wife are wonderful breeders! When I went to go pick up Louie they lived on a beautiful home with lots of land for the puppies! Louie was also micro chipped and had all of his vaccines up to date for 8 weeks!<br> Overall it was a wonderful experience I have nothing but great things to say about them! If you’re looking for a puppy for your family I highly recommend checking out serenity hills!"</div></br></b>
    <div class="itembox"><img src="file:///C:/Users/oluwah/Desktop/eze/myweb/doubles/t2.jpeg"width="200" height="200"><b>Milo.
We were blessed to find our latest addition to our family at Doodle Rach. Milo is the sweetest and most lovable puppy you could ask for.<br> The entire transaction from start to finish was seamless and Lori was great to work with and talk with.<br>  Coincidentally we were able to get Milo into the vet for a check the day after his arrival and everything was exactly the way the Yoder's said it would be.<br> A 100% clean bill of health. They were truthful and honest which is rare these days.<br>  We definitely recommend Serenity Hill and the Yoder's if you are looking for this breed of dog. We are sure you will not be disappointed!</div></br><b/>

"We got our Portuguese Water Dog pup, Luna, from Doodle Rach Puppies and couldn't be happier! David answered all of our questions, made the process super easy and helped coordinate transportation to CA.<br> Our pup was well taken care of and has transitioned easily into our family. She has taken well to her crate,<br> has learned sit and lay, and is already walking to the door to let us know when she needs to go out.<br> Thank you David and Serenity Hill Puppies for the perfect addition to our family!"

    <div class="itembox"><img src="file:///C:/Users/oluwah/Desktop/eze/myweb/doubles/t4.jpeg"width="200" height="200""> " We found Cottonwood Creek Doodles by searching for the breed, Aussiedoodles, in Utah. <br>We read about how they raise their puppies and we knew we were dealing with people who loved dogs. <br>We immediately applied to be on the wait list! These girls are dedicated to finding good homes for their puppies and making sure that all of them are well taken care of.<br> They were amazing to work with and made the process easy! This goofy, energetic, adorable puppy is a member of our family now! "</div>
    <div class="itembox"><img src="file:///C:/Users/oluwah/Desktop/eze/myweb/doubles/t5.jpeg"width="200" height="200"><b>" We found Cottonwood Creek Doodles searching for breeders near our town in Idaho. While there were others that were closer none seemed to care as much for their pups as these ladies. We were sold and put ourselves on the waiting list as soon as we could. From the initial contact all the way through picking up our new fur baby they were always responsive to questions and kept us involved in the process. We loved the online video feed (we actually got to see his litter being born☺)<br> and all of the pictures! Our sweet, cuddly Leonard fit right in to our family. He loves being outside. <br> While being precocious and playful he is very smart and extremely trainable. His little personality, demeanor with children and other animals is perfect.<br> We tell everyone that compliments us on our handsome little man that we got him from Cottonwood Creek Doodles!

" My wife and I are empty nesters with both girls off at college.  After losing our 13 year old Boxer Lady Belle to cancer last summer it took several months of having no one to come home to when we both looked at each other and said “It is time”. We knew we wanted something different. A breed that we could take anywhere and be a key part of the family. <br>Bringing another boxer into the house didn’t seem right. So we turned to the internet and started studying the “doodle” breeds. We were immediately fascinated by the Aussiedoodle. The intelligence, the beautiful looks and the challenge the breed would bring to us. Then we discovered Cottonwood Creek Doodles. An immediate connections was made with the owners Ashley and Jessie. <br>Their passion for the breed and love for their furry Mom’s and Dad’s was overwhelming. Once we made the decision to go with Cottonwood Creek Doodles the ladies made the process so enjoyable. <br>Their command of social media made it feel like we were right there with them as the puppies were born, whelped, socialized and introduced to the world. We were so lucky to have had the opportunity to bring Riley home shortly after Christmas. The bond was made while driving from Salt Lake to Phoenix. <br>It was game on! She has become the perfect addition to our family. We have had a lot of breeds in our adult lives but the Aussiedoodle is the sharpest and easiest to train of all of them. Riley challenges us every day with a desire to learn. She was a total hit on vacation to Pismo Beach and San Luis Obispo,<br> loves the desert trails, swimming in the pool and agility training. She goes everywhere with us and when approached by people they are quick to take down the name “Cottonwood Creek Doodles”.
